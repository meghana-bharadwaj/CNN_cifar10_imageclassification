CIFAR-10 Image Classification
The CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 32x32 images into 10 categories (e.g., airplanes, cats, cars). Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it covers data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and predictions, showcasing the power of CNNs in computer vision tasks.

A machine learning project to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The project demonstrates the power of deep learning in solving image classification tasks.

Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 classes:
1.  Airplane
2.  Automobile
3.  Bird
4.  Cat
5.  Deer
6.  Dog
7.  Frog
8.  Horse
9.  Ship
10.  Truck
This project involves building a CNN model to classify these images into their respective categories.
