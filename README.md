# CNN_cifar10_imageclassification
The CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 32x32 images into 10 categories (e.g., airplanes, cats, cars). Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it covers data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and predictions, showcasing the power of CNNs in computer vision tasks.
